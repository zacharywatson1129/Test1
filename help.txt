Help File for the Complex Plasmas Simulation Program.

Following is the keys and their corresponding action:
	
	'q' - (quit) - exit the application.
	
	'o' - switch to top view
	
	'O' - switch to side view
	
	'f' - switch to frustrum view
	
	'F' - switch to orthogonal view
	
	'p' - pause the simulation.
	
	'P' - unpause the simulation (you must press this upon startup, the simulation is paused by default)
	
	'r' - switch to rotate mode

	'R' - switch to Translate mode

	'x' - hold key to rotate on x***********

	'X' - hold to rotate the other way***************

	'y' - hold key to rotate on y***********

	'Y' - hold to rotate the other way***************

	'z' - hold key to rotate on z************

	'Z' - hold to rotate the other way***************

	't' - turn tracing on (shows the lines of paths of the particles)

	'T' - turn tracing off

	'b' - turn on showing the bottom ring (the plate)

	'B' - turn off showing the bottom ring
	
	'm' - start recording the simulation window.
	
	'M' - stop recording the simulation window.
	
	'D' - hold this key to increase drag
	
	'd' - hold this key to decrease drag
	
	'V' - increase the power on the lower plate
	
	'v' - decrease the power on the lower plate

	'C' - increase the power on the side cavity

	'c' - decrease the power on the side cavity
